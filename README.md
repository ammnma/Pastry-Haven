# Pastry-Haven
I created a simple yet visually appealing pastry website. The design features a warm and inviting color scheme. The "About" page gives a brief introduction to the cafe, while the "Menu" page highlights four different menu items with clear visuals. The "Contact" page includes basic details along with a form for easy interaction.
